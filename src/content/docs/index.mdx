    Akin to works like Tolkien's *Middle-earth*, *Neawist* is the setting where our mythopoeic (myth-making) endeavours come to fruition. Within in, we incorporate and build upon our folklore to craft a rich, engaging world.

    The best way to support our work is by sharing it with those who would find value in it. We also welcome those knowledgeable in our traditions to reach out and share what they know.
