    Akin to works like Tolkien's *Middle-earth*, *Neawist* is the setting where our mythopoeic (myth-making) endeavours come to fruition. Within in, we incorporate and build upon our folklore to craft a rich, engaging world.

    To build upon our tradition, we must come to know and understand it. With Lorehouse – a library dedicated to preserving and sharing our folklore and tales – we set ourselves upon a firm foundation.

    At its core, all the endeavours of *Spellworc* are designed with community in mind. Whatever the project, we strive to make our work collaborative and open, and we would be gladdened for you to join us on our <XLink href={links.discord.general}>Discord server</XLink>.
