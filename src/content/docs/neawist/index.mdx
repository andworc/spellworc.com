Akin to works like Tolkien's *Middle-earth* or C. S. Lewis' *Narnia*, *Neawist*
is the setting where our mythopoeic (myth-making) endeavours come to fruition.
Here, we incorporate and build upon our folklore to craft a rich, engaging
world. Through this work we, we hope to rekindle the fire of tradition within
our kin.
