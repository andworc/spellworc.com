<Oswine>
My name is _Oswine Wenlock_, and I started _Spellworc_ to promote the English and wider European tradition.
</Oswine>
I have always felt that something fundamental missing from our modern lives. Even as a child, I longed for a life like those depicted in Victorian or Edwardian period dramas— there seemed something truer to their lives than in our own, despite it being literal fiction. I felt likewise towards my grandparents's lives: though more fraught with struggle and hardship, they seemed to find greater fulfilment and meaning.

This modern age, bound in pursuit of vapid materialism, is lacking its soul. That is why it is so important that we remember our tradition and heritage, and not let it fall by the wayside. This is what drives this endeavour.

*Spellworc* was born out of my desire to kindle the fires of tradition within myself. Despite always feeling a deep connection to our heritage, I was sharply aware of my ignorance regarding it.  Knowing that I was not alone in this feeling, I sought a way to share my journey and discoveries with others who felt likewise.

As one just beginning the journey, I knew it was unright to position myself as an authority on this matter.  Instead, I sought a path more suitable to my skills: deciding to harness my creative abilities to build upon our folktales, bringing a focus back to our heritage— much like the works of *Tolkien* have done for so many— while also using my web development experience I had to create a central home for our folklore that would be appealing and accessible to the modern man.
