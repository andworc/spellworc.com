  title="Neawist"
  description="Where we make our own contribution to our folklore tradition."

  <LinkCard
    title="Lorehouse"

</CardGrid>

## Getting involved

Our hope is for this to evolve into a community endeavour, where we can come together to
merrymake our shared heritage and contribute our particular knowledge to it.

### Fellowship

A fundamental aspect of our work here at Spellworc is the cherishment of
community. Our efforts are rooted in honouring the worth of our kin and
forefathers, which is inseparable from the spirit of fellowship. We would be
delighted for all good men to engage with us through our <XLink href={links.discord.general}>Discord server</XLink> or by
email at <a href={`mailto:${links.email.general}`}>{links.email.general}</a>.

please reach out by email at <a
